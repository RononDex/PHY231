An automobile company, which does not want to be mentioned, has asked you to deliver them a simulated data set to find out after which distance they have to replace the transmission. They measured the number of kilometers traveled by a given car before its transmission ceases to function. The expectation is that it holds 150'000 kilometers. In addition they have an uncertainty on the measurement of the kilometers, that they estimate to be 10 kilometers. Keep your simulation as general as possible, maybe they want another data set for a different car in the future.
