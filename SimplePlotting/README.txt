Recently the International Physics Olympiad (IPhO) took place here at UZH.
We were asked to produce some plots for an article about the event.

You have to produce several plots, for more information see plotting.py.

Every country was allowed to bring up to five participants. Each participant
took an experimantal and a theoretical exam.

The dataset contains the following columns:

Column 1: Student ID
Column 2: country
Column 3: experiment score
Column 4: theory score
Column 5: total score

The maximum points in the experimental part were 20 points.
In the theoretical part 30 points were the maximum.

The participants were awarded different medals, according to their total score:

Gold medal:        >= 39.8 points
Silver medal:      >= 30.7 points
Bronce medal:      >= 22.7 points
Honorable mention: >= 17.5 points
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tasks
1) Basic plotting of the data:
    a) Histogram of total score
    b) Scatter plot of experiment vs theory score
    c) Histogram of medals/mentions
